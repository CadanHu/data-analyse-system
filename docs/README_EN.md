## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### Dual-Engine Analysis Logic
- ✅ **Smart SQL Engine**: Driven by SQLAlchemy, supporting MySQL and PostgreSQL. Automatically recognizes schemas and converts natural language into high-precision SQL statements.
- ✅ **RAG Knowledge Base Enhancement**: Supports uploading PDF/Markdown/TXT, integrates **PyMuPDF** and **MinerU** for efficient parsing, combined with **ChromaDB** vector storage to assist AI in terminology alignment and business metric interpretation.

### Native Mobile Experience
- 📱 **Full Platform Adaptation**: Built with Capacitor 6, natively supporting **iOS (iPhone)** and **Android (Pixel/Samsung)**.
- 👁️ **AI Thought Process Visualization**: Standard SSE streaming transmission, real-time display of DeepSeek R1 reasoning chains, making AI inference transparent and visible.

### Enterprise-Grade Backend Architecture
- 🏗️ **Unified Adaptation Layer**: Implements cross-database general schema extraction and asynchronous query execution based on SQLAlchemy.
- 🔒 **User Authentication System**: Complete JWT registration, login, and token verification processes, supporting multi-user data isolation.
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization**: Asynchronous FastAPI architecture combined with standard Event-Stream protocol ensures second-level response times.
